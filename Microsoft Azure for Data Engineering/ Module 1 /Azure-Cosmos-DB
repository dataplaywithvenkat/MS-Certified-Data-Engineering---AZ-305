## Introduction

**Azure Cosmos DB** is a fully managed, globally distributed, multi-model database service by Microsoft, designed to enable high availability, low latency, and scalable solutions. It is engineered to meet the demands of modern applications by offering planet-scale, NoSQL capabilities with support for multiple APIs.

### Key Highlights
- **Global Reach**: Deploy your data across multiple Azure regions worldwide.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Use SQL API, MongoDB API, Cassandra API, Gremlin API, and Table API.
- **Guaranteed Performance**: 99.999% availability SLA, with latency under 10 milliseconds for reads and writes.

## Key Concepts

### Globally Distributed Multi-Model Database

Azure Cosmos DB is a **NoSQL database** that supports multiple data models, which allows developers to use the most suitable API for their application's requirements. The database is globally distributed, ensuring low latency and high availability across multiple Azure regions.

### Supported API Models

Azure Cosmos DB supports several API models, enabling you to leverage different database paradigms based on your application's needs:

- **SQL API**: For structured data, similar to traditional relational databases. Uses SQL-like queries.
- **MongoDB API**: Designed for document-based data using JSON documents. Enables seamless migration from MongoDB.
- **Cassandra API**: Supports wide-column data stores, ideal for applications requiring high write throughput.
- **Gremlin API**: For graph-based data models, allowing complex relationships and traversal queries.
- **Table API**: A key-value store that supports fast read/write operations, similar to Azure Table Storage.

**Example Use Cases**:
- Use **MongoDB API** for semi-structured data like user profiles or product catalogs.
- Use **Cassandra API** for IoT telemetry data, where high write throughput is required.
- Use **Gremlin API** for social network applications with complex relationship queries.

## Use Cases and Deployment

Azure Cosmos DB is ideal for applications that require global distribution, low latency, and scalability. It is particularly suited for scenarios such as real-time analytics, IoT data ingestion, e-commerce applications, and gaming leaderboards.

### Scenario: Contoso's E-commerce Solution

**Contoso**, an e-commerce retailer based in Manchester, UK, faced challenges with slow performance for its Australian customers due to latency issues. The problem was caused by the company's only data center being located in London. To resolve this, Contoso:

1. **Migrated Data**: Moved their on-premises SQL database to Azure Cosmos DB using the SQL API.
2. **Improved Latency**: Leveraged the Microsoft Australia East data center to replicate data closer to Australian customers.
3. **Enhanced Performance**: Achieved significant improvements in shopping cart responsiveness, reducing customer complaints and increasing sales in the region.

## Core Features of Azure Cosmos DB

### Global Distribution

Azure Cosmos DB is designed for **global distribution** right from the ground up. You can:
- Replicate your data across multiple Azure regions to improve availability and reduce latency.
- Configure **multi-region writes** for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Enable automatic **failover** to ensure business continuity in the event of a regional outage.

### High Availability and SLA

- **99.999% SLA**: Azure Cosmos DB guarantees an uptime of 99.999% (five nines) for read and write operations.
- **Automatic Failover**: The database can automatically failover to another region in case of a disaster, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Manual Failover**: You can also invoke a failover using the Azure Portal or programmatically.

### Latency and Performance

- **Single-Digit Millisecond Latency**: Cosmos DB ensures a response time of less than 10 milliseconds for both reads and writes when correctly provisioned.
- **Multi-Master Replication**: Provides low latency and high availability by enabling multiple write regions, often achieving sub-second response times globally.

### Consistency Levels

Azure Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels to balance between performance and data accuracy:

1. **Strong**: Guarantees the highest level of data consistency, ensuring that reads return the most recent committed version.
2. **Bounded Staleness**: Ensures a lag of no more than a specified time interval or number of versions.
3. **Session**: Guarantees consistency for a specific client session, making it ideal for user-specific data.
4. **Consistent Prefix**: Ensures that reads never see out-of-order writes.
5. **Eventual**: Offers the lowest latency but with eventual consistency; suitable for applications where performance is critical, and data accuracy is not a top priority.

## Data Ingestion and Querying

### Data Ingestion Methods

Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple ways to ingest data:

- **Azure Data Factory**: For large-scale ETL processes to move data into Cosmos DB.
- **Custom Applications**: Build applications that use Azure Cosmos DB's APIs to insert data.
- **JSON Document Uploads**: Directly upload or edit JSON documents using the Data Explorer.
- **AzCopy Tool**: For fast data migration to Cosmos DB.

### Querying and APIs

- **Stored Procedures, Triggers, and User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: You can write server-side logic using JavaScript.
- **Data Explorer**: Provides a visual interface to explore and query data.
- **Graph Visualization**: Use the Graph API with Gremlin to visualize relationships.

**Example Query (SQL API)**:
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.city
FROM customers c
WHERE c.city = 'Sydney'
```

## Security and Compliance

Azure Cosmos DB provides robust security and compliance features to meet the needs of enterprises and applications that require high levels of security and regulatory adherence.

### Security Features

- **Encryption at Rest**: All data in Cosmos DB is encrypted at rest using Azure-managed keys or customer-managed keys.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS for secure communication between applications and Cosmos DB.
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control through Azure Active Directory (AAD) and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Audit Logs**: Azure Cosmos DB integrates with Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to provide comprehensive audit logs for tracking and monitoring access and operations.

### Compliance

Azure Cosmos DB is compliant with several key industry standards and certifications:

- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Information security management.
- **SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3**: Controls relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality.
- **GDPR**: Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation for handling EU citizens' data.
- **HIPAA**: Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for healthcare data.
