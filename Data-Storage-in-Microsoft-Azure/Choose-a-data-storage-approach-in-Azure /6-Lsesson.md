## Introduction

Applications often need to group a series of data updates together, especially when one piece of data needs to trigger a change in another. Transactions help you manage these updates, ensuring that if one event fails, the entire series of updates can be rolled back or undone. For example, in an online retail scenario, a transaction can be used to group the placement of an order with payment verification. This ensures that inventory levels aren't reduced until an approved payment is received.

In this guide, we’ll learn about transactions and whether they are necessary for your data management system.

## Understanding Transactions

A **transaction** is a logical group of database operations that execute together. To decide if you need transactions, ask yourself: **Will a change to one piece of data in your data set impact another?** If the answer is yes, then your database service must support transactions.

Transactions are often defined by a set of four key principles, known as the **ACID guarantees**.

## ACID Guarantees

Transactions are governed by four principles, often referred to as ACID:

1. **Atomicity**: A transaction must execute exactly once, and it must be atomic. Either all operations are completed, or none of them are. This ensures that incomplete transactions do not leave the data in an inconsistent state.
2. **Consistency**: The data must be consistent before and after the transaction. It ensures that any changes made during the transaction bring the database from one valid state to another.
3. **Isolation**: One transaction must not be impacted by another. This ensures that the operations of a transaction are isolated from other transactions, preventing conflicts.
4. **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure. The system guarantees that the changes will be saved and available after a restart.

When a database offers ACID guarantees, it applies these principles consistently across all transactions.

## OLTP vs OLAP

- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: These databases are used to store transactions and records. They are optimized for handling high volumes of small transactions and are typically designed to support many concurrent users. OLTP databases are used in systems where data is frequently inserted, updated, or deleted.
  
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: OLAP is used for organizing large business databases to support complex queries and data analysis. OLAP systems are optimized for running analytical queries without impacting transactional systems, making them ideal for tasks like data mining, business intelligence, and financial analysis.

While OLTP and OLAP are less commonly used as terms today, they still help categorize application needs based on whether the focus is on transactional operations or complex data analysis.

## Online Retailer Scenario

Let’s explore how transactions apply to different datasets in an online retail scenario:

### Product Catalog Data

Product catalog data requires **transactional support** because:
- When a user places an order and the payment is verified, the inventory for the item must be updated.
- If a customer's credit card is declined, the entire order should be rolled back, including the inventory update.

These relationships between orders, payments, and inventory require the integrity and rollback capabilities provided by transactions.

### Photos and Videos

Photos and videos do **not** require transactional support because:
- These files are only changed when updates are made or new files are added.
- Even though there’s a relationship between the product data and the media (e.g., images or videos), this relationship is not transactional in nature.
  
As a result, transactions are not necessary for handling photos and videos.

### Business Data

Business data, being historical and unchanging, **does not** require transactional support. The data is primarily used for:
- Aggregated queries for analysis, like comparing sales by region over specific periods.
- These queries do not involve updates to the original data, and thus the transactional guarantees (like ACID) are not needed.

## Conclusion

Transactions help ensure data integrity by enforcing ACID principles, which are crucial when multiple related operations need to be grouped together. If your data requires such guarantees—especially when one piece of data impacts another—transactions are necessary for your storage solution. If your data is read-only or doesn’t require such strict consistency (e.g., photos, business analysis), transactional support may not be needed.

Choosing a storage solution that supports transactions is critical for maintaining data consistency and reliability in applications that require complex data updates.
